This project was conducted to search through a large text file, perform complex computations, 
and attempt to find the largest palindromic prime number within the first 100 trillion digits 
of the decimal expansion of the constant pi. 
The search resulted in the discovery of a 25-digit palindromic prime, along with several 23-digit ones. 
This work can be used to analyze improvements in primality testing for large numbers and to compare the 
performance of arrays versus lists for code optimization in Python. It also addresses computational limitations, 
presenting additional challenges to solve.
